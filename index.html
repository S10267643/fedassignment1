      <p class="two">
          「星街すいせい」is a Japanese Vtuber who debuted on March 22, 2018. She was originally an independent up until July 1, 2018, where she joined a group called "S:gnal". A month later, her manager made an announcement that she would be graduating from the said group.<br><br>

          As time progressed during her career, she came to the realization that carrying on with her activities as a solo idol was becoming too difficult.
          Sui-chan tried to do various things to gain more attention and even went to the extent of finding jobs, like making MVs for companies to fund her own activities.<br><br>
          
          Around 2019, she applied to join Hololive as part of their Vtuber talents. Sadly, her initial application was turned down. Knowing that she could no longer keep up being a solo, 
          she mustered up the courage to reply to the same e-mail that informed her about her rejection, asking them if they would somehow give her a chance to prove herself to join Hololive.
          In which she succeeded and, alongside AZKi, was assigned to be a part of INNK MUSIC, a music label under Hololive.

  <p class="name">HOSHIYOMI </p>
  <p class="description">
  The name of Sui-chan's fanbase. Originally named as "Cometomo" 「こめとも」which was decided by a Twitter poll on May 5, 2018, during Suisei's first live stream on YouTube.
  It was then changed to name her fanbase as "Hoshiyomis" 「星詠み」meaning Stargazers in English. A clever name, seeing as they are the ones observing and watching our Comet Idol.
